# 📊 Model Card: CELM — Cardiomegaly Ensemble Learning Model

CELM is an ensemble deep learning model trained to detect **cardiomegaly** from frontal chest X-ray images. It combines three CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3) into a unified ensemble classifier using a dense meta-layer.

## ✅ Intended Use

- Medical imaging research
- Teaching and education
- Decision support tool (non-diagnostic)

## ⚙️ Training Details

- Training data: 46,078 CXRs (balanced cardiomegaly vs. normal)
- Source datasets: CheXpert, NIH ChestX-ray14, PadChest, VinDr-CXR
- Preprocessing: CLAHE, normalization, augmentation (random flips, brightness, rotation)

## 📈 Performance

- **F1-score**: 0.97
- **Accuracy**: 97.8%
- **Precision**: 98.4%
- **Recall**: 97.4%

## 🔍 Limitations

- Designed for binary classification (cardiomegaly vs. normal/other Findings)
- Does not support lateral CXR or other thoracic conditions
